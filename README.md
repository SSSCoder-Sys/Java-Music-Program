# Java Music Program
This program was created using Java (specifically JDK 17). This was created with the help of BroCode, his YouTube Channel has a bunch of videos to watch where people wanting to get into Computer Science can learn bunch of langauges.
I will say, I learned a lot with this project such as exceptions, what to catch, how to handle them etc. and this is very valuable since in my CS class, I'm working with exceptions in the UNIX environment. So far, I'm slowly progressing
in coding and I hope to create much bigger projects.

## How this program works:
This program can only use audio files in these three formats:
- .wav
- .au
- .aiff
If you want to use .mp3 files, you'll need to work with JavaFX which I haven't worked with yet but I'm considering looking into it in the future.

Audio files must be placed in the src folder so that the program can see the file. File path must be declared in the program so if you have multiple songs, make sure to have their file paths listed (e.g., src/name_of_song.wav)
Again this was created by following along BroCode so please don't think I'm calling this my own program. However, I think I can make this into a mini Java spotify player by being able to incorporate multiple songs (if I do that, I'll make a commit to this page)
